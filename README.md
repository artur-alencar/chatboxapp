This is my first full-stack project, and I decided to use Django because I was more familiar with Python. 
The code is technically not functional since it can't connect itself to other users, but I didn't make to be functional (maybe in future updates I could add communication between different users) I made this project to test my programming skills such as:
- HTML structure;
- CSS styling;
- Making the page interactive with JavaScript DOM;
- Sign up, Log in and Log out logic using Python and Django;
- Addiing Django logic into HTML templates;
- Using csrf token to make the forms safe;
- Creating databases using Django's ORM;
- Allowing users to change information in the database;
- Adding database info inside the HTML code;

There are still things I want to change about the project and you are free to give me feedback and some tips about my code at arturwalencar@gmail.com
